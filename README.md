# alt's Shiptest Fork

-   **Original Shiptest Codebase** <https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest>
-   **Wiki:** <https://shiptest.net/wiki>

This is the codebase for the Ship-based Shiptest flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13.

Shiptest is a thrill-packed round-based exploration and roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a whimsical metal spacefaring machine masquerading as a spaceship, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and it's dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive with your crew!
